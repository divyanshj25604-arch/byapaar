Byapaar is a modern fintech web platform empowering MSMEs with smart, transparent, and instant financial solutions. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a sleek landing page, login system, and tools for credit, invoices, and secure digital payments.
Byapaar is a static, single-page fintech landing website built using pure HTML and CSS.

The objective was to design a clean, modern interface for a hypothetical MSME-focused financial platform.

The project includes:
	•	Hero section with CTA
	•	Features section
	•	Testimonials
	•	Navigation bar
	•	Footer
	•	Responsive layout

No JavaScript, backend, or database is used — the website is fully static and created as a front-end design showcase.
